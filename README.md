# *Blackjack!*
I created a digital version of the casino classic, "Blackjack" using multiple fundamental python skills learned at the intermediate level.

About the game:
- Blackjack is a casino banking game. The most widely played casino banking game in the world, it uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One.
